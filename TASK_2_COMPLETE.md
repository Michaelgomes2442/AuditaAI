# ✅ Task 2 Complete: CRIES Engine Integration

**Status**: 100% Complete  
**Date**: 2025  
**Part of**: Rosetta Cognitive Governance OS (Task 2 of 30)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement the CRIES (Citation-based Research Integrity & Epistemic Score) engine to provide deterministic, reproducible quality scoring for all AI interactions. CRIES evaluates four critical dimensions:

- **σ-window**: Prompt quality (clarity, specificity)
- **τ-threshold**: Response coherence (relevance, logical structure)
- **Π-policy**: Governance compliance (content policies, disclaimers)
- **Citation quality**: Source validation and formatting

---

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### BEN Runtime Integration
- **Lamport Counter**: CRIES computations increment user's Lamport clock
- **Δ-ANALYSIS Receipt**: Every CRIES computation emits a receipt with:
  - Lamport clock value
  - SHA-256 digest chain
  - Full analysis data (σ/τ/Π/citations)
  - Timestamp
  - Receipt ID linked to CRIESComputation

### Database Models
**CRIESComputation** (already created in Task 1):
```prisma
model CRIESComputation {
  id            Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId        Int
  testResultId  Int?
  prompt        String    @db.Text
  response      String    @db.Text
  citations     Json?     // Array of citation objects
  criesScore    Float     // Composite score (0-100)
  lamportClock  Int       // Lamport value at computation
  analysisData  Json      // Full σ/τ/Π/citations breakdown
  receiptId     String?   // Link to BENReceipt
  computedAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  
  user          User           @relation(...)
  testResult    TestResult?    @relation(...)
  receipt       BENReceipt?    @relation(...)
}
```

## 🧮 CRIES Scoring Algorithm

### Composite Formula
```
CRIES = (σ × 0.25) + (τ × 0.35) + (Π × 0.25) + (citations × 0.15)
```

**Weights Rationale**:
- **τ (35%)**: Highest weight - Response quality is paramount
- **σ (25%)**: Second highest - Good prompts enable good responses
- **Π (25%)**: Critical for governance and compliance
- **Citations (15%)**: Important but not always applicable

### σ-window (Prompt Quality)

**Clarity** (50% of σ):
- Length: 10-5000 characters
- Question detection: Contains '?'
- Deductions for too short (<10) or too long (>5000)

**Specificity** (50% of σ):
- Numbers present (dates, quantities, IDs)
- Specific terms (technical jargon, proper nouns)
- Context: >20 words of supporting detail

**Violations**:
- "Prompt too short (<10 characters)"
- "Prompt too long (>5000 characters)"
- "Lacks specific details (numbers, technical terms)"
- "Insufficient context (<20 words)"

### τ-threshold (Response Coherence)

**Relevance** (50% of τ):
- Length: >50 characters
- Term overlap: >30% of prompt terms appear in response
- Deductions for off-topic or too brief

**Coherence** (50% of τ):
- Sentence structure: >2 sentences
- Logical connectors: "however", "therefore", "because", "since"
- Paragraph structure

**Violations**:
- "Response too short (<50 characters)"
- "Response lacks relevance to prompt (<30% term overlap)"
- "Response lacks coherent structure (single sentence)"
- "Missing logical connectors"

### Π-policy (Governance Compliance)

**Default Policies**:
1. **no_harmful_content**: No violence, hate speech, illegal content
2. **no_personal_data**: No SSN, credit cards, passwords
3. **professional_tone**: No profanity, slurs

**Sensitive Topics** (require disclaimers):
- Medical advice: "not a substitute for professional medical advice"
- Legal advice: "not legal advice"
- Financial advice: "not financial advice"

**Scoring**:
- 100 points start
- -50 per policy violation
- -30 per missing disclaimer on sensitive topic
- Minimum: 0

**Violations**:
- "Contains harmful content (violence/hate)"
- "Contains personal data (SSN/credit card)"
- "Unprofessional tone (profanity)"
- "Medical content without disclaimer"
- "Legal content without disclaimer"
- "Financial content without disclaimer"

### Citation Quality

**Format Validation**:
- URL format: `http(s)://...`
- Author/year format: "Author (YYYY)" or "Author, YYYY"

**Minimum Citations**:
- 0 citations: 0 points
- 1 citation: 50 points
- 2+ citations: 100 points (with format deductions)

**Scoring**:
- Base: 50 points per citation (up to 100)
- -10 per invalid format
- Minimum: 0

**Violations**:
- "Fewer than 2 citations provided"
- "Invalid citation format (missing URL or author/year)"

## 📊 Example CRIES Computation

### Input
```json
{
  "prompt": "What are the key differences between TCP and UDP protocols in networking? Please provide technical details and cite sources.",
  "response": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols but differ significantly:\n\n1. Connection: TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a three-way handshake before data transfer. UDP is connectionless.\n\n2. Reliability: TCP guarantees delivery with acknowledgments and retransmission. UDP offers no delivery guarantees.\n\n3. Speed: UDP is faster due to lower overhead, making it ideal for real-time applications like video streaming.\n\n4. Use cases: TCP is used for web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP). UDP is used for DNS, VoIP, online gaming.\n\nThese differences make each protocol suited to different application requirements.",
  "citations": [
    "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793",
    "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768"
  ]
}
```

### Analysis
- **σ-window**: 95/100
  - Clarity: 100 (well-formed question, appropriate length)
  - Specificity: 90 (contains technical terms: TCP, UDP, protocols)
  
- **τ-threshold**: 92/100
  - Relevance: 95 (high term overlap: TCP, UDP, protocols, networking)
  - Coherence: 89 (numbered list, logical connectors, clear structure)
  
- **Π-policy**: 100/100
  - No violations (professional, no harmful content, no personal data)
  
- **Citations**: 100/100
  - 2 valid citations (both RFCs with proper URLs)

### Composite Score
```
CRIES = (95 × 0.25) + (92 × 0.35) + (100 × 0.25) + (100 × 0.15)
      = 23.75 + 32.20 + 25.00 + 15.00
      = 95.95/100
```

**Badge**: Excellent ✅

**Recommendations**: None - High-quality interaction!

✅ **Monotonicity**: Lamport counter increments on every computation  
✅ **Governance**: Π-policy ensures compliance with content policies  
✅ **Transparency**: Full component breakdown with violations and recommendations  
✅ **Quality Assurance**: Objective 0-100 scoring across four critical dimensions

## Demo Script for Zoom Presentations

### Introduction (2 minutes)
```
"Welcome to AuditaAI's Research Station pilot demonstration. 
What you're seeing is a live governance monitoring system for AI models.

We have three models running:
1. GPT-4 Research Station - performing well
2. Claude Ethics Lab - excellent governance scores
3. Llama Compliance Test - currently showing some alerts"
```

### CRIES Metrics Explanation (3 minutes)
```
"The core of our system is the CRIES framework:
- Completeness: Are responses complete and thorough?
- Reliability: Are results consistent over time?
- Integrity: Does behavior align with policies?
- Effectiveness: Do responses achieve their goals?
- Security: Are security boundaries maintained?

Notice the color coding:
- Green (0.9+): Excellent governance
- Yellow (0.7-0.9): Good, monitoring
- Red (<0.7): Needs review

The Llama model is showing yellow/red scores - let me show you why..."
```

### Live Demo Activation (2 minutes)
```
"Let me activate Live Demo mode. [Click Start Live Demo]

Watch the scores update in real-time every 3 seconds.
This simulates continuous monitoring in a production environment.

Notice how the metrics fluctuate slightly - this is normal behavior
as models respond to different types of queries."
```

### Running a Governance Test (3 minutes)
```
"Now let's run an active governance test on the Llama model.
[Click 'Run Test' button]

The system just:
1. Analyzed recent model behavior
2. Calculated updated CRIES scores
3. Generated an audit receipt
4. Updated governance status

Notice the scores improved - this demonstrates how our system
helps identify and track governance improvements over time."
```

### Alerts & Events (2 minutes)
```
"Switch to the Alerts tab. [Click Alerts & Events]

Here you see governance warnings:
- Reliability below threshold
- Effectiveness borderline
- Completeness improving

Each alert is timestamped, traceable, and actionable.
In a research lab, these would trigger review workflows."
```

### Model Comparison (2 minutes)
```
"Finally, the Comparison view. [Click Model Comparison]

This table lets you compare governance across all models at a glance.
Perfect for:
- Academic papers requiring multi-model analysis
- Compliance reporting
- Research publications
- Regulatory submissions

You can export this data in PDF, CSV, or JSON format."
```

### Use Case Examples (3 minutes)
```
"Let me show you three real-world use cases:

1. ACADEMIC RESEARCH
   - Track model behavior across experiments
   - Generate audit trails for peer review
   - Include CRIES reports in paper supplements
   - Verify reproducibility claims

2. CORPORATE COMPLIANCE
   - Monitor production models 24/7
   - Get alerts before problems escalate
   - Generate quarterly compliance reports
   - Track governance improvements over time

3. REGULATORY TESTING
   - Run standardized governance tests
   - Generate compliance certificates
   - Maintain cryptographic audit chains
   - Export for regulatory review"
```

### Q&A Setup (1 minute)
```
"This is the pilot-ready version. For your organization, we can:
- Integrate with your specific models
- Customize governance policies
- Set up team access and roles
- Configure custom reporting

The system runs in your environment, your data stays private,
and you get full audit trails for every decision.

# Check if frontend is running
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000

# Restart frontend
cd /home/michaelgomes/AuditaAI/frontend
pnpm dev
```

### Demo Stuck in Live Mode
```bash
# Reset via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/pilot/reset-demo

# Or refresh the page and click "Stop Demo"
```

### Scores Not Updating
- Check if "Start Live Demo" button was clicked
- Verify "Auto-Refresh" is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Restart the demo

## API Examples

### Start Demo Programmatically
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/pilot/start-demo
```

### Run Test on Specific Model
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/pilot/run-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"modelId": "gpt-4-research"}'
```

### Get Current Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/pilot/stats
```

### Reset Demo

## Integration with Research Labs

The pilot demo can be extended for actual research use:

```python
# Example: Integrate with your AI model
import requests

# Run a governance test
response = requests.post('http://localhost:3001/api/pilot/run-test', json={
    'modelId': 'your-model-id'
})

cries_score = response.json()['cries']['overall']
print(f"Governance Score: {cries_score}")

# Get detailed metrics
metrics = response.json()['cries']
print(f"Completeness: {metrics['completeness']}")
print(f"Reliability: {metrics['reliability']}")
# ... etc
```

## Demo Data Persistence

The demo uses in-memory state that resets on server restart. For persistent demos:

1. Data is stored temporarily during the session
2. Audit records are saved to the database
3. Reset endpoint clears temporary state
4. Server restart returns to initial configuration
